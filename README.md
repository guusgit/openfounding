# openfounding
try &amp; fail project to make Elon Musk use its money to solve world hanger. 

# Hello There
This project's purpose is to propose an open source visualisation for an important matter : how to solve world's hunger issue, with money.  
  
Doing this on my free time, with no expected results. let's have fun.

# Main idea
It would be nice to have a very simple project. I'm not even sure it would require a database.  
  
So, what am I talking about ?
  
A full front page, displaying the huge amount of initial founding (6B$), and some pipe to where it is supposed to be spend.

(((( 6 000 000 000 $ ))))

idk if that makes sense like that, but still, I want to display a cashflow. Where to spend it, how much, if one shoot is enough and so on.
  
Saying that induce a simple more or less static page. pretty cheap to be done. But by doing that, I would only be able to display MY vision. And I'm pretty deadly sure that i'm not the one with the solution.
  
So, what about a meta model ? or a simple small mongo DB ... frack, idk yet.
  
in addition, i'm not on my freetime right now. We'll talk later.
