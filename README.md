# openfounding
try &amp; fail project to make Elon Musk use his money to solve world hanger. 

# Hello There
This project's purpose is to propose an open source visualisation for an important matter : how to solve world's hunger issue, with money.  
  
Doing this on my free time, with no expected results. let's have fun.

# Main idea
It would be nice to have a very simple project.
  
So, what am I talking about ?
  
A full front page, displaying the huge amount of initial founding (6B$), and some pipe to where it is supposed to be spend.

(((( 6 000 000 000 $ ))))  
  |       |             |  
Crop    peon training   harvest  

  
idk if that makes sense like that, but still, I want to display a cashflow. Where to spend it, how much, if one shoot is enough and so on.
  
Saying that induce a simple more or less static page. pretty cheap to be done. But by doing that, I would only be able to display MY vision. And I'm pretty deadly sure that i'm not the one with the solution.
  
So, what about a meta model ? or a simple small mongo DB ... frack, idk yet.
  

# Quick'n'Dirty specification
Front : Any graphic framework able to display charts and pipe (i want some fucking pipes to modelize the cashflow !)  
Back : Ultra light program. Maybe a spring thing, we would need few class, mainly to access the database  
DB : dirty mongo  

What kind of data would we need ?  
- investment : cash amount on a specific date for a specific purpose to improve the situation. Input cash amount, output result
- quick answer : almost the same but no feedback expected. The quick answer is to buy food somewhere to put it somewhere. Period. Input cash amount, output people surviving.
- ???
  
# Discussion
What is not said here is that investing to solve world hunger is necessary but won't stop the bleeding immediatly. Some quick answer should be considerate. There is no magic food as there is no magic money (hello there President Macron), so we have to look at what is around us right now.
  
Another point, is that us, westerners, have to be prepared to make some sacrifice regarding our own comfort. Let's say that the major hunger issue is only in Africa (which is not the case). We should reroute the exportation toward western countries to inner african countries. Doing so, they would loose exportation money (that's one part where your money get involved, Elon), and us, will loose some exotic products on our markets.  
But let's be honest, is that that important to have banana all year long in our supermarket ? I guess not, maybe it would be better to "give" it to the ones who are starving.

One funny thing. Really funny. So funny that I think I'm gonna cry.   
The Congo is in the top tier. I still can buy banana from there in my supermarket EVERYDAY. Why won't they keep it for their own population. FOR MONEYYYYYY  
Madagascar is also in the top tiers. Well, they make TONS of shrimps. Only exportated, too expension for the Malgash people. So they are starving to generate money for some. Money again.
  
  
Having that said, I'm pretty sure money has nothing to do with world hunger. Corruption does.
